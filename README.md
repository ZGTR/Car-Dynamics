# Car-Dynamics

<strong>Breif</strong>
<br/>For a grasp, go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NtnupALEh4">here</a> directly for a video. This is the early a very rough build of one of my very  [relatively] first big project back in 2010. This was my third year of studying in the Faculty of Information Technology Engineering in Damascus, Syria, with Ismaeel Abo Abdalla, Zaher Wanli and Mhd Noor Alhamwi. The project simulates the physics of the car movement with/without Anti Brake-Lock System (ABS), Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Global Positioning System (GPS) all in realtime.
